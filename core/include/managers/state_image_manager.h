/**
 * @file state_image_manager.h
 * @brief Declaration of StateImageManager class
 *
 * @details
 * This class manages the asynchronous processing state of the image being edited.
 * It acts as a coordinator between the image source, the infrastructure contexts
 * (Pipeline & Workers), and the working image memory.
 *
 * **Key Architectural Features:**
 * - **Contexts:** Owns `PipelineContext` (Strategies) and `WorkerContext` (Executors).
 * - **Move Semantics:** All data processing methods accept ownership of data via `std::move`.
 * - **Thread-Safe:** Uses mutexes to protect the working image and status flags.
 * - **Stateless Processing:** Does not store operation lists; it receives, processes, and discards.
 * - **Single Persistent Worker:** Uses ONE background thread for all processing, avoiding
 *   the overhead of thread creation/destruction during rapid UI interactions.
 * - **Coalescing Updates:** If an update is requested while the worker is busy,
 *   the new request overwrites the pending one. Intermediate requests are discarded,
 *   ensuring only the latest state is processed.

/**
 * @class StateImageManager
 * @brief Manages the working image lifecycle and coordinates asynchronous processing.
 *
 * @details
 * This class receives processing requests (e.g., apply operations) from the engine,
 * prepares the working memory, delegates execution to workers via the WorkerContext,
 * and updates the final result. It implements a coalescing strategy for incoming
 * operations to optimize responsiveness during rapid UI interactions.
 *
 * **Threading Model:**
 * The class owns a single persistent background thread (`m_worker_thread`).
 * No new threads are spawned during image processing.
 *
 * **Coalescing Behavior (e.g., Slider Dragging):**
 * - When `applyOperations` is called, if the worker is idle, processing starts immediately.
 * - If the worker is already processing, the new operations are stored as pending,
 *   **overwriting** any previously pending operations.
 * - Superseded `std::future` objects from intermediate calls are resolved immediately
 *   to prevent caller blocking.
 * - When the worker finishes its current task, it checks for pending work. If present,
 *   it processes the *latest* one. If absent, it goes to sleep.
 * - The final `std::future<bool>` returned by `applyOperations` resolves only when
 *   the operation *actually executed* completes.
